\title{Connecting path with arcs}

\begin{document}

\maketitle

We want to connect rail tracks with continuous curves, but Bezier curves and B-splines suffer from the problem that they cannot calculate the exact length.
It is problematic for us because we are using the distance to interpolate nodes in a constant interval, and also predict the distance to decelerate.
So we consider using arcs, which are sections of circles that have a constant curveture over its span.

\label{fig:arc}
\end{figure}

In figure \ref{fig:arc}, we denote the center of the circle of the arc as $A$.
The point at which the previous path ends is denoted as $B$.
We would like to continue the path from $B$, keeping the direction continuous (i.e. $C^1$ continuous).

Let's say the user clicked on the point $C$.
We would like to find the parameters of the arc, which are:
\begin{itemize}
    \item $A$ - center of the arc circle
    \item $R$ - the radius of the curve
    \item $\theta$ - the angle of the arc.
\end{itemize}

Let's call the direction change from the point $B$ to $C$ as $\phi$.
We can compute $\phi$ from the clicked point $C$ like
$$
\phi = \arctan\left({\frac{C_y - B_y}{C_x - B_x}}\right) - \phi_0
$$
where $\phi_0$ is the angle of direction from previous path.

We can also compute the distance between $B$ and $C$ as $L = ||\vec{BC}||$.

From $\phi$ and $L$, we can calculate the radius as
$$
R = \frac{L}{2 \sin\phi}.
$$

With some simple geometry, we observe that $\theta=\frac{\phi}{2}$.

With all these information, you can determine the arc.
